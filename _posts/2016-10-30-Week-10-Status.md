## Architecture Project

* No deliverables this week.

## Case Study

* We individually drafted high level architecture designs for InternetTV.
* We met as a group on 10/28 to discuss out designs and finalize a design for submission.

## Concerns Going Forward

* Any emails, regardless of whom they are directed to, need to have all team members carbon copied.
