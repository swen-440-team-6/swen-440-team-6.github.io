## Architecture Project

* The introduction and background sections of the Architecture Documentation were written.
* The requirements section, which we broke up into functional requirements and architecturally significant requirements, was written. These are the architecturallly significant requirements that we defined:
  * User Data is accessible from the mobile application and the web application.
    * Requires the system to have a central database with all user information stored.
  * An organization overview is exportable in a variety of formats.
    * Requires a variety of file formats that the data can be converted into. This selected is made by the user when they request a data export.
  * The system should have 99% uptime, to ensure that event check-ins can occur smoothly throughout the day.
    * Fault detection and correction tactics will be built in so that the system will detect when problems occur and attempt to fix them quickly.
* We addressed four quality attributes: availability, security, interoperability, and performance (both fault detection and correction).
* We began creating architecture diagrams for the Voluntracker system.

## Concerns Going Forward

* Any emails, regardless of whom they are directed to, need to have all team members carbon copied.
