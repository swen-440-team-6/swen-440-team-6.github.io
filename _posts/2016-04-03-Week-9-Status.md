# Project Status

## Performed Heuristic Evaluations

This week we did heuristic evaluations on our projects in class. Two of our team members evaluated another team's project, while the other three of us observed and compiled feedback from two people evaluating our project design. The feedback received has been reviewed and ranked based on severity, and will be used to further improve our design.

## Begun Application Implementation

We also have started to begin our implementation of the application. It's a small step of stubbing out the basics of our application, but we wanted to get an early start on development.
