## Brainstorming
This week, our team as a whole spent about 2 hours brainstorming project
ideas and writing them down. Some of the ideas we came up with included
a barcode scanning application that shows environmental information, a
QR-code scanning app for hard-of-hearing customers to order items at a
restaurant, and a formula helper app to help students remember math and
science formulas.

## Project Startup
We decided as a team to build the barcode scanning app for finding
environmental information. We envision that users will use the application
to share information about the environmental effects of products, such
as whether or not they're recyclable, or whether they contain harmful
pollutants.

## Blog setup
Aside from the time we spent coming up with the project ideas, Gareth also spent 2 hours creating a basic github pages blog so we could track our time.
