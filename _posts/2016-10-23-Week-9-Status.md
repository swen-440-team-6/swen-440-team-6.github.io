## Architecture Project

* We updated the Project Plan from the Requirements Project to reflect new deadlines and expected risks.

## Case Study

* We diagrammed the Quality Attributes (QA) Utility Tree.
* We documented one QA Scenario.
* We documented the design tactics relevant to the QA Scenario.

## Concerns Going Forward

* Any emails, regardless of whom they are directed to, need to have all team members carbon copied.
