# Project Status

## Final Prototype Fixes and Presentation

For our final week we took a look at our feedback that we got from our testing and applied the suggested changes to our app. Luckily there weren't that many things to change.

After that we went about creating our presentation to display the fruits of our labor to the class. In our presentation we covered our original requirements, and how they evolved along with our designs. We also go over some of the design rationale for our application and give a quick demo.

It's been a long road but we feel like we learned a lot about usability and how to design an interface that not only looks good, but also functions in a way that our end users will understand.
