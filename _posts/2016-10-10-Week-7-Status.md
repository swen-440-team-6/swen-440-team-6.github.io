## Software Requirements Specification

* The SRS document has been updated to address all of the feedback given based on the first draft.
* The Analysis Models (Stereotype, Class, and Sequence Diagrams) for three of our use cases have been included in Appendix B. 

## Project Plan

* The Defect Log has been updated to represent the current status of the project.

## Use Case Document

* The Use Case Document has been updated to address the given feedback.
* The individual Use Cases have been verified for accuracy.

## Presentation

* The Project Presentation has been create and finalized. Each person on the team has been assigned a single slide to present.

## Reflection

* We received a much lower than expected grade on the draft of our SRS document. A lot of factors combined to cause this and we worked really hard to ensure that those same risks were mitigated before beginning to work on the final draft.
* Quite possibly the biggest difference in the team’s preparation between the draft and the final SRS was been the amount of formal processes that have been implemented internally.
* The team established a finishing date of a day before the deliverable was due, and the day of delivery was dedicated to reviewing all documents to make sure everything was ready for submission.
* This put more pressure on the team to work on their tasks earlier, and spread the work out over the course of the two weeks instead of saving it all for a few days.
* This also meant that collaboration with the sponsor was easier, since there was more time for questions to be answered.
* Also important was assigning two group members to look over, perform QA control, and submit the document. This ensured that all documents were ready for submission, and no questions remained as to who’s job it was to gather all documents and submit them.
