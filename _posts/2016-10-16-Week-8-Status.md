## Requirements Project

* All deliverables for the requirements project have been submitted.
* A summary of our project and a reflection of our work was presented in class on 10/12.
  * Unfortunately, two of our team members were ill and unable to present.
* Overall, our grades for the Final SRS were much higher than for the SRS Draft!

## Case Study Part 4: Architecturally Significant Requirements

* The team collaborated remotely to complete the architecturally significant requirements section of the case study for InternetTV.

## Concerns Going Forward

* Any emails, regardless of whom they are directed to, need to have all team members carbon copied.
