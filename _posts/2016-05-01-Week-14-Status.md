## Usability Testing 

This week, Ben, Kyle, Gareth, and Adam completed two usability tests each. All tests were completed using the same basic template with the following usability tasks:

- Get environmental information for a product by scanning.
- Get environmental information for a product by searching.
- Register an account.
- Comment on a product.
- Up/Down vote a comment.

At the end of each testing session, participants were asked to answer a few survey questions about their overall user experience. Once all of the testing sessions were completed, we all came together to analyze the observations from the testing sessions and determined areas of our application that needed revision.
