## Project Status

1. Draft of Software Requirements Specification
  * We received a much lower grade than we expected. There were some misunderstandings on our part that led to the Project Plan not being updated, among other documents.
  * Initially, we lost credit for the blog post because it did not appear on the site. This is due to the fact that in order for posts to display on the site, they have to be in a particular directory AND be named with the file extension for Markdown <em>(.md)</em>. We received credit because there was a GitHub commit log showing that it was written and submitted on time.
  
2. Going Forward
  * We met on Friday (09/30) to discuss what went wrong and how we can work to mitigate the risks that led to our poor grade. Below is a list of whom is responsible for what aspects of the final draft.
