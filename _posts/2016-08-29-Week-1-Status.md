## Project Sponsor Information
Name: Brock Wagehoft

Email: bew1127@rit.edu

Occupation: Fraternity Chairmen of Community Service

## Summary of Project Description Received from Sponsor
Mr. Wagehoft is the community service Chairman within his fraternity organization. Members of the fraternity must provide a summary of their servce activities - including hours and a contact for verification - to Mr. Wagehoft. He has found it difficult to keep track of all of this information for every member of his organization within a spreadsheet. He would like a web-based, mobile-friendly application that can help him keep track of his organization's community service hours.

## Desired Functionality
* A web-based, mobile-friendly application <b>OR</b> a fully mobile application.
* Account Management:
  * Master Accounts for organization Chairmen to manage their organization's members and to view aggregate data of their member's activity.
  * User Accounts for that allow for easily providing dates, times, locations, event descriptions, start and end times, and contact information for their activities.
* Organization Information Pages:
  * Compare your organization's community service activities with other organizations.
* Easily exportable data.

## Blog Creation
The blog is hosted on GitHub at [https://swen-440-team-6.github.io/](https://swen-440-team-6.github.io/).
