## Initial Project Idea
For our project, we would like to design a replacement for the current automatic group creation system used by many professors, primarilly in the Software Engineering department. The current system has limited functionality, which often results in undesirable groupings.

## Potential Project Sponsor
Since we foresee this application being used primarily by SE professors, Asma has scheduled a meeting with Daniel Krutz.

## Blog Creation
Ben created the blog, which is hosted on GitHub at [https://swen-440-team-6.github.io/](https://swen-440-team-6.github.io/). It is simple and to-the-point.
