# Project Status - Conceptual & Intermediate Design
This week we constructed a persona for Holly, a basic user for our application.
Using her persona, we drafted some storyboard sketches which we were able to use
to create a series of wireframes to give us a feel of what our application might
look like and what features it will need to have.

## Persona
Holly is a 32-year-old female who is very ethical in her buying decisions and
loves finding bargains. She is a business woman who travels often and her
smartphone is an extension of her body; it is an indispensible tool for her
daily life. She is environmentally conscious and wants to make sure she isn't
making detrimental decisions.

Adam worked on the initial persona on his own time, before we all worked together
to solidify a final persona.


## Storyboard
Using our final persona, we all worked on the following storyboard:

1. Holly is at the grocery store while on a business trip in an unfamiliar state.
2. She wants to buy a boxed item, but isn’t sure if the box is recyclable in her area.
3. She opens the scanner app and scans the barcode. The app tells her it isn’t recyclable.
4. Holly looks for a similar item and scans that barcode; the app tells her that item is recyclable.
5. Holly picks the recyclable item and puts it in her cart.

## Wireframes
As a group we looked at each step in the storyboard individually and
brainstormed possible wireframe models for the user interface. We settled on
designs for a variety of the screens for our application.

# Future Plans
Next week, we will use the wireframes that we have developed to plan out and
create a more detailed design prototype. Feedback from in-class activities will
be used to enhance our final prototype.
