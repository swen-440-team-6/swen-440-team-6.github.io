Phat Plats is our team name for our SWEN 444 group. This is the Human Center Requirements and Design course @ RIT within the Software Engineering program.

The goal of this project is to create a design that will be intuitive, and provide an amazing user experience.
The purpose of this blog is to document the process in building that experience.
